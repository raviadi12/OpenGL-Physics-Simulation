# N-Body and Spring Simulation with OpenGL

This project is an OpenGL-based simulation for visualizing both N-body gravitational interactions and spring dynamics. The project is built using C++ and the OpenGL library.

## Features

### N-Body Simulation

- Simulates the gravitational interactions between multiple celestial bodies.
- Real-time 3D visualization.
- User can free roam around the simulation environment.

### Spring Simulation

- Simulates the oscillatory motion of a spring-mass system.
- Real-time controls for changing physical parameters.
- Real-time 3D visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler
- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLAD
- GLM

### Installation

- Clone the repository
- Compile and run the project

#### Or

- Download the [release file](https://github.com/raviadi12/OpenGL-Physics-Simulation/releases/tag/Relaeased) and run the executable.

## Usage

### Controls for Spring Simulation

- **Arrow Up**: Increase amplitude
- **Arrow Down**: Decrease amplitude
- **Arrow Left**: Decrease frequency
- **Arrow Right**: Increase frequency
- **A/D**: Decrease/Increase stiffness
- **W/S**: Decrease/Increase damping
- **E/Q**: Decrease/Increase target amplitude
- **T/P**: Decrease/Increase time modulation
- **F/G**: Decrease/Increase force scale
- **F11**: Toggle fullscreen

### Controls for N-Body Simulation

- Free roam (no specific controls).
